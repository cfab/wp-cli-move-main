# Implementation Summary

## Features Added

I have successfully added support for syncing WordPress plugins, mu-plugins, and themes to the wp-cli-move package. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. New Data Types
Added three new data type constants to `MoveCommand.php`:
- `DATA_TYPE_PLUGINS = 'plugins'`
- `DATA_TYPE_MU_PLUGINS = 'mu-plugins'`
- `DATA_TYPE_THEMES = 'themes'`

### 2. Updated Command Line Interface
Both `pull` and `push` commands now support these new flags:
- `--plugins`: Sync only the plugins folder
- `--mu-plugins`: Sync only the mu-plugins folder
- `--themes`: Sync only the themes folder

### 3. New Sync Methods in MoveCommand
- `sync_plugins()`: Handles plugins directory synchronization
- `sync_mu_plugins()`: Handles mu-plugins directory synchronization  
- `sync_themes()`: Handles themes directory synchronization
- `sync_directory()`: Generic directory sync method that reduces code duplication

### 4. New Path Methods in Alias Model
- `get_plugins_path()`: Returns WordPress plugins directory using `WP_PLUGIN_DIR`
- `get_mu_plugins_path()`: Returns WordPress mu-plugins directory using `WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR`
- `get_themes_path()`: Returns WordPress themes directory using `get_theme_root()`

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Updated README.md with new command options and usage examples
- Created NEW_FEATURES.md with detailed implementation documentation

## How It Works

1. **Path Resolution**: Each alias uses WordPress constants and functions to determine the correct paths for plugins, mu-plugins, and themes directories
2. **Rsync Transfer**: Files are synchronized using the same rsync configuration as uploads (with progress, compression, deletion, etc.)
3. **Bidirectional Support**: Works for both push and pull operations
4. **Selective Sync**: Users can choose to sync specific data types or all types (default behavior)

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Default behavior (syncing all data types) is preserved when no flags are specified
- Existing command syntax continues to work exactly as before

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Pull plugins and themes from staging
wp move pull staging --plugins --themes

# Push only plugins to production  
wp move push production --plugins

# Sync everything (unchanged behavior)
wp move pull staging

# Dry run to preview changes
wp move push staging --plugins --dry-run
```

The implementation follows the existing code patterns and maintains consistency with the current architecture.
